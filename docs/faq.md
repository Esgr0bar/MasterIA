# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## ü§î General Questions

### What is MasterIA?
MasterIA is an AI-powered tool for automated audio mixing and mastering. It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze audio tracks and provide intelligent suggestions for effects, mixing decisions, and creative enhancements.

### How does MasterIA work?
MasterIA analyzes audio files using advanced feature extraction techniques, then applies trained machine learning models to suggest appropriate effects, mixing decisions, and creative cuts. The system learns from professional reference tracks and user feedback to improve its suggestions over time.

### What makes MasterIA different from other AI audio tools?
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple AI models (CNN, Random Forest, SVM) for robust predictions
- **Creative Features**: Suggests creative cuts, glitches, and unique effects
- **User Feedback Integration**: Learns from your preferences to improve suggestions
- **Genre-Specific Models**: Specialized models for different music styles
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source with transparent algorithms

### Who can use MasterIA?
MasterIA is designed for:
- **Music Producers**: Rapid prototyping and professional mixing
- **Independent Artists**: Home studio enhancement
- **Audio Engineers**: Starting point for professional mixes
- **Students**: Learning audio production principles
- **Educators**: Teaching mixing and mastering concepts

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### What are the system requirements?
- **Operating System**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.14+, Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+)
- **Python**: 3.8 or higher
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 2GB free space for models and cache
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor recommended

### I'm getting installation errors. What should I do?

**Common solutions:**

1. **Update Python and pip**:
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   ```

2. **Install system dependencies** (Ubuntu/Debian):
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install python3-dev libsndfile1-dev ffmpeg
   ```

3. **Use virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Check Python version**:
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.8 or higher
   ```

### Can I use MasterIA without GPU?
Yes! MasterIA works perfectly on CPU-only systems. GPU acceleration is optional and provides 2-3x speed improvement for model training, but all features work without GPU.

### How do I enable GPU acceleration?
If you have a compatible NVIDIA GPU:
```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu
```
MasterIA will automatically detect and use GPU when available.

## üìÅ Data & File Formats

### What audio formats does MasterIA support?
- **Primary**: WAV (44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz) - *Recommended for best quality*
- **Secondary**: MP3, FLAC, OGG, AIFF
- **Bit Depths**: 16-bit, 24-bit, 32-bit floating point
- **Channels**: Mono and stereo

### How should I organize my audio files?
```
data/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio_with_metadata/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ track1.wav
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ track1.json
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ track2.wav
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ track2.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ new_audio/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ new_track1.wav
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ new_track2.wav
```

### What should be in the metadata JSON files?
```json
{
  "title": "Track Name",
  "artist": "Artist Name",
  "genre": "Hip-hop",
  "bpm": 120,
  "key": "C major",
  "effects": [
    {
      "effect": "EQ",
      "target": "vocals",
      "level": 0.7
    },
    {
      "effect": "Compression",
      "target": "drums",
      "level": 0.5
    }
  ]
}
```

### Can I use MasterIA with stereo files?
Yes! MasterIA supports both mono and stereo files. However, it converts to mono for analysis by default. If you need stereo-specific processing, you can modify the loading parameters.

### My audio files are very long. Will this cause problems?
Large files can cause memory issues. Recommendations:
- Process files in segments (30-60 seconds)
- Use lower sample rates for analysis (22050 Hz)
- Consider splitting long files before processing

## üéµ Usage & Features

### How do I get started with my first mix?
1. **Prepare your files**:
   ```bash
   # Place audio files in the data directory
   mkdir -p data/audio_with_metadata
   cp your_track.wav data/audio_with_metadata/
   ```

2. **Run MasterIA**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Review suggestions** and apply feedback

### What types of suggestions does MasterIA provide?
- **Mixing Effects**: EQ, compression, reverb, delay, filtering
- **Mastering**: Multiband compression, limiting, stereo widening
- **Creative Edits**: Glitches, cuts, stutters, transitions
- **Level Adjustments**: Volume, panning, dynamics

### How accurate are the AI suggestions?
MasterIA achieves 85-92% accuracy on mixed genre datasets. Accuracy varies by:
- **Genre**: Hip-hop (92%), Electronic (89%), Rock (85%)
- **Audio Quality**: Higher quality input = better suggestions
- **Training Data**: More training data = better accuracy

### Can I customize the AI suggestions?
Yes! You can:
- **Provide feedback** to train the model on your preferences
- **Adjust parameters** in the configuration
- **Train custom models** for specific genres or styles
- **Filter suggestions** by effect type or intensity

### How do I train a custom model?
```python
from src.model_training import train_model
from src.feature_extraction import extract_basic_features

# Load your specific training data
audio_data, metadata = load_audio_files_with_metadata("your_training_data/")

# Extract features
features = extract_basic_features(audio_data)

# Train custom model
X, y = prepare_data_for_training(features, metadata)
custom_model = train_model(X, y)

# Save the model
import joblib
joblib.dump(custom_model, "models/custom_model.pkl")
```

### Can I use MasterIA for different music genres?
Yes! MasterIA supports multiple genres:
- **Hip-hop/Rap**: Optimized (primary focus)
- **Electronic**: Well-supported
- **Rock/Metal**: Good support
- **Pop**: Good support
- **Jazz**: Experimental support
- **Classical**: Limited support

You can train genre-specific models for better results.

## üîß Technical Issues

### MasterIA is running slowly. How can I speed it up?
**Quick fixes:**
1. **Use lower sample rates**:
   ```python
   audio, sr = librosa.load(filename, sr=22050)  # Instead of 44100
   ```

2. **Process shorter segments**:
   ```python
   audio, sr = librosa.load(filename, duration=30)  # 30 seconds
   ```

3. **Use parallel processing**:
   ```python
   from multiprocessing import Pool
   # Process multiple files simultaneously
   ```

4. **Enable caching**:
   ```python
   # Cache extracted features to avoid recomputation
   ```

See the [Performance Guide](performance.md) for detailed optimization techniques.

### I'm getting "out of memory" errors. What should I do?
**Memory optimization strategies:**
1. **Process files in batches**:
   ```python
   def process_in_batches(file_list, batch_size=10):
       for i in range(0, len(file_list), batch_size):
           batch = file_list[i:i+batch_size]
           # Process batch
   ```

2. **Use generators**:
   ```python
   def audio_generator(file_list):
       for filename in file_list:
           yield load_audio_efficiently(filename)
   ```

3. **Clear variables**:
   ```python
   import gc
   del large_variable
   gc.collect()
   ```

4. **Reduce audio quality temporarily**:
   ```python
   audio, sr = librosa.load(filename, sr=16000, mono=True)
   ```

### Model training fails. What's wrong?
**Common issues and solutions:**

1. **Insufficient training data**:
   - Need at least 10-20 tracks per genre
   - Ensure balanced dataset

2. **Incorrect data format**:
   - Check JSON metadata format
   - Verify audio file integrity

3. **Memory issues**:
   - Use smaller batch sizes
   - Reduce model complexity

4. **Label inconsistencies**:
   - Verify metadata labels are consistent
   - Check for missing or malformed labels

### The AI suggestions don't sound good. How can I improve them?
**Improvement strategies:**

1. **Provide feedback**:
   ```python
   # Rate suggestions and provide feedback
   feedback = collect_user_feedback(actions, cuts)
   save_feedback(feedback)
   ```

2. **Use more training data**:
   - Add more reference tracks
   - Include diverse examples

3. **Adjust model parameters**:
   ```python
   model = train_model(X, y, n_estimators=200)  # More trees
   ```

4. **Train genre-specific models**:
   - Create separate models for each genre
   - Use genre-specific training data

5. **Post-process suggestions**:
   - Apply your own filters
   - Combine with manual adjustments
