# AI-Based Audio Mixing and Mastering

## Overview

This project aims to develop an AI-powered tool for automated audio mixing and mastering. The tool leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze and replicate the effects applied to reference tracks, enabling rapid processing of audio files.

### Key Features

- **Automated Mixing and Mastering**: AI-driven analysis and application of audio effects.
- **Flexible Adjustment**: Users can choose from different effect intensities and manually tweak the results.
- **Support for Various Genres**: The AI can be calibrated to handle different music genres, starting with rap.

### Project Structure

- **Data Processing**: Functions for loading and preparing audio data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Methods to extract useful features like MFCCs and spectrograms.
- **Model Training**: Scripts to build, train, and evaluate machine learning models.
- **User Interface**: A simple application interface (to be developed).
