# Jupyter Notebooks

## Overview

The Jupyter notebooks included in this project are designed for data exploration and model training. They provide an interactive environment where you can test different approaches and visualize the results.

### Available Notebooks

- **EDA.ipynb**: Explore the raw audio data, visualize waveforms, spectrograms, and MFCCs.
- **Model_Training.ipynb**: Build and train machine learning models for audio processing.

### How to Use

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - Ensure that you have all dependencies installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
   - Start Jupyter with the command `jupyter notebook`.

2. **Open a Notebook**:
   - Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
   - Open `EDA.ipynb` to start exploring the data or `Model_Training.ipynb` to begin training models.

3. **Run Cells**:
   - Execute code cells by selecting them and pressing `Shift + Enter`.
   - Modify parameters as needed to experiment with different settings.

4. **Save Your Work**:
   - Donâ€™t forget to save your notebook regularly. You can also export it as HTML or PDF for sharing.
