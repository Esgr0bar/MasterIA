## Data Format Guidelines

### 1. Raw Audio Data

- **Audio Format**: All raw audio files should be in WAV format with a sample rate of 44.1kHz or higher.
- **Directory Structure**: 
  - Each song should have its own directory inside `data/raw/tracks/`.
  - Inside each song directory, include:
    - `vocals.wav`: Isolated vocals track.
    - `drums.wav`: Isolated drums track.
    - `bass.wav`: Isolated bass track.
    - `mix.wav`: The final mixed track.
    - etc...

### 2. Metadata

- **Format**: JSON files.
- **Structure**:
  - Each song should have a corresponding metadata file in `data/raw/metadata/` named `songname_metadata.json`.
  - The JSON file should contain details about the applied effects, such as EQ settings, compression ratios, reverb parameters, etc.
  
  Example structure:
  ```json
  {
    "vocals": {
      "eq": {"low_cut": 100, "high_cut": 10000},
      "compression": {"threshold": -20, "ratio": 4}
    },
    "drums": {
      "eq": {"low_cut": 50, "high_cut": 15000},
      "compression": {"threshold": -15, "ratio": 3}
    }
  }
  ```
